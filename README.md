# searchbar
a client for the green site where you search for tags instead of images

on december 17, 2025, i was bored. so i made this

imma be honest its extremely scuffed

but it works

the use case is when you want to search tags using the searchbar but you dont actually want to open the green site

update 12/26/25 v1.1.0
* gelbooru support
* loading indicator
* combining tags (when there is xxx:shirt and gel:shirt, they will be removed and become xxx+gel:shirt, with their counts combining)
* site indicators (when a tag named "shirt" comes from rule34.xxx, it will become "xxx:shirt". you cannot disable this yet, but why would you want to)
